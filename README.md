# Relation Network Model: Enhancing Few-Shot Learning in Biomedicine

## Overview
This project aims to implement and benchmark a novel algorithm in the field of few-shot learning, particularly for biomedical applications. We focus on the Relation Network (RN) model, a significant advancement in few-shot learning, and its application to biomedical datasets like Tabula Muris and SwissProt.
